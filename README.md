# Deep-Learning-Models-for-Network-Annomaly-Detection

The modular app consists for mainly three annomaly detection algorithms. The system supports models both in Tensorflow and Pytorch.

 - Annomaly DAE
 - DeepSphere
 - VAE

The key aspect is extensibilty and the ability to add more models as required. The repository structure is as follows.
